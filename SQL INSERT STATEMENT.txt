1) Inserting data directly into a table

We can insert a row in the table by using SQL INSERT INTO command.

There are two ways to insert values in a table.

In the first method there is no need to specify the column name where the data will be inserted, you need only their values.


INSERT INTO table_name  
VALUES (value1, value2, value3....);  
The second method specifies both the column name and values which you want to insert.

INSERT INTO table_name (column1, column2, column3....)  
VALUES (value1, value2, value3.....);  



2)Inserting data through SELECT Statement
SQL INSERT INTO SELECT Syntax

INSERT INTO table_name  
[(column1, column2, .... column)]  
SELECT column1, column2, .... Column N  
FROM table_name [WHERE condition];
