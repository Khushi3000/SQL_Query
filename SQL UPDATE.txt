The SQL commands (UPDATE and DELETE) are used to modify the data that is already in the database. The SQL DELETE command uses a WHERE clause.


SQL UPDATE statement is used to change the data of the records held by tables. Which rows is to be update, it is decided by a condition. To specify condition, we use WHERE clause.

The UPDATE statement can be written in following form:

UPDATE table_name SET [column_name1= value1,... column_nameN = valueN] [WHERE condition]  


UPDATE table_name  
SET column_name = expression  
WHERE conditions  

SQL statement:

UPDATE students  
SET User_Name = 'beinghuman'  
WHERE Student_Id = '3'  


Source Table:

Student_Id	FirstName	LastName	User_Name
1	Ada	Sharma	sharmili
2	Rahul	Maurya	sofamous
3	James	Walker	jonny


Student_Id	FirstName	LastName	User_Name
1	Ada	Sharma	sharmili
2	Rahul	Maurya	sofamous
3	James	Walker	beinghuman


Updating Multiple Fields:

If you are going to update multiple fields, you should separate each field assignment with a comma.

SQL UPDATE statement for multiple fields:

UPDATE students  
SET User_Name = 'beserious', First_Name = 'Johnny'  
WHERE Student_Id = '3'  

Result of the table is given below:

Student_Id	FirstName	LastName	User_Name
1	Ada	Sharma	sharmili
2	Rahul	Maurya	sofamous
3	Johnny	Walker	beserious


MYSQL SYNTAX FOR UPDATING TABLE:

UPDATE table_name  
SET field1 = new-value1, field2 = new-value2,  
[WHERE CLAUSE]  


SQL UPDATE SELECT:

SQL UPDATE WITH SELECT QUERY:

We can use SELECT statement to update records through UPDATE statement.

SYNTAX:

UPDATE tableDestination  
SET tableDestination.col = value  
WHERE EXISTS (  
SELECT col2.value  
FROM  tblSource  
WHERE tblSource.join_col = tblDestination. Join_col  
AND  tblSource.Constraint = value)  


UPDATE   
Table   
SET  
Table.column1 = othertable.column 1,  
Table.column2 = othertable.column 2  
FROM   
Table  
INNER JOIN  
Other_table  
ON  
Table.id = other_table.id  


My SQL SYNTAX:

If you want to UPDATE with SELECT in My SQL, you can use this syntax:

Let's take an example having two tables. Here,


First table contains -

Cat_id, cat_name,

And the second table contains -

Rel_cat_id, rel_cat_name

SQL UPDATE COLUMN:

We can update a single or multiple columns in SQL with SQL UPDATE query.

SQL UPDATE EXAMPLE WITH UPDATING SINGLE COLUMN:

UPDATE students  
SET student_id = 001  
WHERE student_name = 'AJEET';  


This SQL UPDATE example would update the student_id to '001' in the student table where student_name is 'AJEET'.

SQL UPDATE EXAMPLE WITH UPDATING MULTIPLE COLUMNS:

To update more than one column with a single update statement:

UPDATE students  
SET student_name = 'AJEET',  
Religion = 'HINDU'  
WHERE student_name = 'RAJU';  
This SQL UPDATE statement will change the student name to 'AJEET' and religion to 'HINDU' where the student name is 'RAJU'.
